# Thea-portfolio


This is my portfolio. I wanted to work on my HTML and CSS skills. This project is entirely coded in these two languages.
I chose a color palet and implemented it on this whole portfolio.
Since I am a beginner in web development, there's only "templates" on the project side of the portfolio. Indeed this porject was only to improve my skills. Once I'll have cool projects to share, I'll modify my code.
